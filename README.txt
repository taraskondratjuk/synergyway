Hello, my server starts with http://localhost/api/

All url, url body and what they do I described in Postman

At first you need create aircompany or airplane or flight  with some body 

For example : localhost/api/airplane/save  

{
    "name":"MMD-35",
    "factorySerialNumber":4467899,
    "numberOfFlights":40,
    "flightsDistance":2000,
    "fuelCapacity":900,
    "type":"passanger",
    "createdAt":"2021-03-22"
}

And then you can delete, add, update, get, change  what are you want(aircompany or airplane or flight)
